### Hello

I'm Bill (a/k/a mavrck) a developer based in Ohio, USA that primarily works in PHP and JavaScript, though I also have a soft spot for Python, Ruby, and other open source languages.

I love to work on projects that help independent radio stations compete with the large ownership groups.

Currently, I'm working on AmpedRadio, Director of Engineering at Acceptd, and run HustleWorks, a boutique digital agency.
