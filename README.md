Hello friend,

I'm a developer based in Ohio, USA that primarily works in PHP and JavaScript, though I also have a soft spot for Python, Ruby, and other open source languages.

I love to work on projects that help independent radio stations compete with the large ownership groups.

Currently, I'm working on AmpedRadio, leading a dev team at Acceptd, and run HustleWorks, a boutique digital agency.

-Bill
